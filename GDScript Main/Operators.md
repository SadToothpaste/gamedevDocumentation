Operators are most commonly used to alter the value of [[variables]] in certain types of ways, or used in [[conditions]] in order to represent what condition needs to be met for the code to run.

**Altering Operators:**
Increments the variable on the left by the amount of the value on the right.
```
variable += value
```

Reduces the value of the variable on the left by the amount of the value on the right.
```
variable -= value
```

Multiplies the value of the variable on the left by the amount of the value on the right.
```
variable *= value
```

Divides the value of the variable on the left by the amount of the value on the right.
```
variable /= value
```


**Condition Operators:**
Checks if the variable on the left is equal to the value/variable on the right 
```
variable == value
```

Checks if the variable on the left is not equal to the value/variable on the right 
```
variable != value
```

Checks if the variable on the left has the same or higher value than the value/variable on the right 
```
variable >= value
```

Checks if the variable on the right has the same or higher value than the value/variable on the left 
```
variable <= value
```

Checks if the variable on the left has a higher value than the value/variable on the right.
```
variable > value
```

Checks if the variable on the right has a higher value than the value/variable on the left.
```
variable < value
```
