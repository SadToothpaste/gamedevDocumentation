Variables are a way to store data. This could be player statistics, the amount of levels passed, the main characters name or even just if an object has been touched or not. There are several different types of variables, all with their different uses.

Depending on where you define your variable, that is where it would be accessible. If you define a variable right under the "extends" line at the top of the script, the variable will be accessible everywhere in the script. But if you were to define it within a function, it would only be accessible within that function.
