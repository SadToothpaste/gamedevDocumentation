Anything put within the two brackets will be printed to the console which you can view in a separate tab when testing your game. Anything within quotation marks will be printed literally, and just inputting a variable will print the value that the variable contains.

**Printing text:**
```
print("Hello!")
```
**Console:**
```
Hello!
```

Printing a variable:
```
var floatVariable = 63.28
print(floatVariable)
```
**Console**:
```
63.28
```
