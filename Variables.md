Variables are a way to store data. This could be player statistics, the amount of levels passed, the enemies names or if an object has been touched or not. There are several different types of variables, all with their different uses.

Float:
```
var floatVariableName = 7.4
```
Float variables can contain any number, including decimal placements.


Int:
```
var intVariableName = 2
```
Int variables can contain any whole number, they are unable to handle decimals.


String:
```
var stringVariableName = "Hello"
```
String variables contain words and sentences that the computer will not take as a command.


Bool:
```
var boolVariableName = true
```
Bool variables are either true or false.
