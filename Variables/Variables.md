Variables are a way to store data. This could be player statistics, the amount of levels passed, the enemies names or if an object has been touched or not. There are several different types of variables, all with their different uses.

Float:
```
var floatVariableName = 7.4
```
Float variables can contain any number, including decimal placements.


Int:
```
var intVariableName = 2
```
Int variables can contain any whole number, they are unable to handle decimals.


String:
```
var stringVariableName = "Hello"
```
String variables contain words and sentences that the computer will not take as a command.


Bool:
```
var boolVariableName = true
```
Bool variables are either true or false.


Vector2:
```
var vector2VariableName = Vector2(0, 0)
```
Vector2 is a variable that contains two number values. The individual numbers can be referenced on top of the entire variable itself by typing the variable name followed by a ".x" or ".y" depending on which one you want to access. ".x" accesses the first one and ".y" accesses the second one.


Vector3:
```
var vector3VariableName = Vector3(0, 0, 0)
```
Vector3 is a variable that contains three number values. The individual numbers can be referenced on top of the entire variable itself by typing the variable name followed by a ".x", ".y" or a ".z" depending on which one you want to access. ".x" accesses the first one, ".y" accesses the second one, and lastly ".z" accesses the third.
