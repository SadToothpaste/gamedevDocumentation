Vector2 is a variable that contains two number values. The individual numbers can be referenced on top of the entire variable itself by typing the variable name followed by a ".x" or ".y" depending on which one you want to access. ".x" accesses the first one and ".y" accesses the second one.

Here is an example on how to define a Vector2 variable:
```
var vector2VariableName = Vector2(x, y)
```
The "x" and "y" [[Variables]] that the Vector2 holds can be replaced with whatever variable you want it to hold.
