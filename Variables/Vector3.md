Vector3 is a variable that contains three number values. The individual numbers can be referenced on top of the entire variable itself by typing the variable name followed by a ".x", ".y" or a ".z" depending on which one you want to access. ".x" accesses the first one, ".y" accesses the second one, and lastly ".z" accesses the third.

Here is an example on how to define a Vector3 variable:
```
var vector3VariableName = Vector3(0, 0, 0)
```
The "x", "y" and "z" [[variables]] that the Vector3 holds can be replaced with whatever variable you want it to hold.
